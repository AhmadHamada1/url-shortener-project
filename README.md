API Gateway	Expose RESTful endpoints
DynamoDB	Store URL mappings and click logs
S3	Host HTML redirect & log JSON files
IAM	Grant least-privilege access
CloudWatch	Log monitoring for Lambdas

HitCount (track clicks):
Looks up long URL from UrlShortener

Increments clicks atomically

Logs access to UrlClickLogs and S3

Redirects user to long URL

Deployment Steps:
Create the required DynamoDB tables

Deploy Lambda functions
